# PLP Bookstore – MongoDB Script

This project sets up a sample MongoDB database called `plp_bookstore` and demonstrates common MongoDB operations such as data insertion, querying, updating, deleting, aggregation, indexing, and performance analysis using `explain()`.

## 📁 File Structure

- `insert_books.js` – JavaScript file containing all MongoDB operations
- `README.md` – Documentation for understanding and using the script

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- MongoDB installed and running
- `mongosh` command-line shell installed
- Alternatively, you can use **MongoDB Compass** to run these queries manually

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Using the Command Line

```bash
mongosh < bookstore_queries.js
